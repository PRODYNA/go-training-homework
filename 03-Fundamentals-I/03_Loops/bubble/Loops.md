# Exercise - Loops

## Bubble Sort

1. Implement bubble sort.
2. Build a large array to sort.
3. Measure performance of your function. Is runtime as expected?

## Tips

Run the tests with "go test -v ./..." for simple execution of all tests.
Run the benchmarks with "go test -v ./... -bench=. -benchtime=10000x" for 10k iterations. This takes at least 2 min.
