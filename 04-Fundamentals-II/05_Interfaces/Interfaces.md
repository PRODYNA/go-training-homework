# Exercise - Interfaces

1. Complete the main.go to remove compiler errors.
   The function fooLib() in lib.go should be called, and the code should panic.
2. Modify the tests to check for panic.
3. Modify the tests and main.go that you can mock FooLib.
   Unmocked code should still panic.

Bonus: Try to call fooLibWithArgs in TestMe and modify the mock.
Why can we call TestMeWithArgs without the "&"?
